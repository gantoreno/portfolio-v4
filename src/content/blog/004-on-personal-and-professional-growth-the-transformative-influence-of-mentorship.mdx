Learning can sometimes be **extremely overwhelming**, starting from scratch is not always pleasant, the idea trying to grasp an entire topic without _any prior knowledge_ can sometimes be enough to prevent us from **learning something new**, does this sound familiar?

If so, it's because that's the struggle we _all_ face at some point when getting into a new field, something we haven't yet had the chance to do or learn, and there's something in common among us all ‚Äì we wish _someone_ could **teach us** one or two things.

![Right from the start, life is all about learning.](./assets/004/learning.webp)

Let's face it, having _someone_ who **knows** about whatever we're trying to learn, who can also _adapt_ to our learning style (and the things we look for when trying to absorb knowledge), as well as being able to ask **as much** as we want, sounds like an absolute dream ‚Äì and you'd be right, because that's what _mentors_ are supposed to be like.

Wait, isn't a _mentor_ a person you task on **teaching children** when they're really young and just getting started with the very basics? Well, short answer ‚Äì **yes**, but that's just a _form_ of mentorship. The long answer is **much more interesting**, and it's a topic I've _personally_ wanted to go over the past few years, as I feel there's much more to the concept than you might expect.

## A bit of background

If there's something I _really_ dislike, is **not** **knowing something**. Don't get me wrong, I say this in a (kinda) healthy way, what I'm referring to is knowing there's something I _could_ learn, but I'm **not doing do so**. Often times, this would lead up to me having to depend on others that _do know_ some of what I'm looking for, which, _may_ or _may not_ have a positive outcome, depends on the case.

![Knowledge is something we all seek for, in various different ways.](./assets/004/library.webp)

This resulted on me having this **extreme** need to learn, to go _above_ _and beyond_ whatever was being given to me at a certain point (like college classes, for example) and trying to **master** whatever knowledge awaited behind any topic's door, trying to fully grasp a lot of stuff at the same time, which, although when mix-matched with determination and consistency **can** be highly beneficial, it can **also** have some unexpected (and not very positive) side effects.

See, it's _not_ good nor healthy to focus all of your attention on trying to learn everything by yourself **without any kind of input or help**, it _may_ be **rewarding** at first but, as everything in life, the best possible way to go around this is to **balance it out**, because if there's a **major blocker** when it comes to learning, is _pressure_, and there's no worst pressure than the one we **inflict to ourselves** while creating this unreachable knowledge bar high above our heads ‚Äì if anything, it'll cause you:

- Lots of **stress.**
- Amounts of **unhappiness**.
- Discomfort with your **own knowledge.**
- Great **discouragement**.

In an ideal world, we shouldn't be afraid of asking about _something_ we don't understand, or reaching out to someone more experienced than us ‚Äì there will **always** be people that knows a _bit less_, or a _bit more_, and for those, the **same rule** applies as well. What I later found out was the actual **root cause** of my general distrust on relying on other people's knowledge was **quite revealing**, yet **seemingly intuitive**: _teaching is a skill in of itself_.

## Realization

After thinking about it over, and over, and over again, and considering every aspect I possibly could, my thought was the following:

> So, if teaching is a skill, then only those who have trained it up into a certain level are the ones capable of sharing knowledge in the correct way, right?

I then had my answer to all the struggles I've had across my **entire** life ‚Äì it's _not_ that I shouldn't rely on others to learn something I don't know, it's just that _not everyone_ has the necessary tools to **effective knowledge sharing**. No matter how hard you try, a receiver will **never** get the information if it doesn't even come out of the emitter in **an understandable way**.

![Learning is also about, guess what, communication.](./assets/004/communication.webp)

This immediately **switched gears** on my brain, and my focus totally **shifted** from ‚Äúwhy is it so hard to learn from other people?‚Äù to ‚Äúmany people might be going through this struggle as well, so, what is the way to become a better communicator? am I part of this situation as well?‚Äù ‚Äì if so, _perhaps_ there's something I can do to not only **get better at communicating**, but also **directly giving others the way to do it too**, but, how _exactly_ am I supposed to develop this skill? Skill requires practice, so, what can I do?

## Taking action

That's when my eyes to the **world of mentorship** really opened up without me realizing it, It started to become clear what the need was, what everyone **struggled with**, what people wanted to **learn** but found **difficult** to really grasp and/or getting to the **right learning resources**, this included not only stuff like videos, articles, courses, but also just people who they can reach out with **questions**, and be sure they'll get an **answer**, even for the stuff they consider to be hard.

![Calculus might be the earliest nightmare a college student faces.](./assets/004/calculus.webp)

You know what else is hard? _Calc I_, that **infamous** course everyone at any tech-related career (such as <Abbreviation title="Computer Science">CS</Abbreviation>) has to face at the early stages of the school program. Let's face it, it's a **nightmare** for most, specially when your assigned teacher is not the most likable person out there.

However, if there's something that defines myself, is that I seek _meaning_ behind everything we do, **specially with numbers**. Most people were afraid because they saw Calculus as this magical thing with a bunch of unpredictable nonsense and symbols, however, I knew there _was_ a meaning behind everything explained there, and a predictable way to get to results ‚Äì the question now is: how can I take this **vision** and share it with the rest?

As the say goes: _just do it_. So, that's exactly what I did, whenever I heard someone ask a question about a formula or a sequence they didn't understand, I tried jumped in (not in the "ü§ì‚òùüèª" kind of way, I promise ‚Äì people don't like that), and just came up with a <Underline>simplification</Underline> of the subject, or whatever fits best, just trying to make everything feel like **building blocks**, not necessarily to _show off_ or brag, or trying to put myself above everyone else ‚Äì it was quite the opposite.

Doing this, I had to **force myself** to try and take everything I know, and putting it to the test of someone else's learning style, accept the risk of getting a question I wasn't that sure about, or that I might not even have the answer to. If I could get someone to understand something _better than I did_, then I'd be doing the right thing. With that, what started as just **mere interventions** later transitioned into **frequent questions**, which then became **study groups**.

Remember I mentioned the word ‚Äúsimplification‚Äù? Stay with it.

## Getting to be a mentor

After I got into programming, and saw how most of the struggles I mentioned earlier on **translated** from **numbers** into **code** and **development**, I followed my same ‚Äúmethod‚Äù, but now it was _better_ (and, believe it or not, _easier_), as programming gives you way more flexibility and interactivity to show concepts or simplify things, and it was absolutely **rewarding**, not just for me, but for everyone that enjoyed having now a clear vision over concepts that appeared to be _random_, and _nonsensical_.

![Code, as abstract as it might be, is a great way to demonstrate concepts.](./assets/004/programming.webp)

With this newly found love for helping others finally learn whatever was challenging them at the time, I stumbled upon a **Reddit post**. Someone was looking for volunteers to join a programming collective as **mentors**. It was aimed to hobbyists and people with some spare time to jump on and help on teaching and accompanying new programmers on their path to learning how to code. This community went by the name of [The Electric Hive](https://www.electrichive.org/) ‚Äì I applied.

The events that followed after my initial mail was something I did _not_ anticipate ‚Äì it was such a **great community**. It was my **first time** formally teaching programming subjects, and boy, did I learn a **ton** over my time there, creating learning roadmaps, having 1:1 sessions with each mentee during the course of the week, hearing their struggles, knowing their strengths, and getting them to a place they wanted to be, meeting awesome people along the way and, right before I moved on in my personal life and stopped taking mentorships, I had one final mentee, let's call him <Underline>Will</Underline>.

I couldn't have asked for a better mentee to wrap things up, as I took my biggest lesson from him. Will didn't come from a technical background, **quite the opposite** in fact, he had _always_ struggled with **technology**, and trying to learn to code was one of the **biggest** **challenges** he could've faced, but he mentioned something really key to what happened later: he has always loved building things with **his own hands**, **repairing** stuff, **tearing** them down, basically anything that involved manual work ‚Äì he had just presented me with _his own_ learning style, and that's when the most important thing clicked in.

_Transformations_.

Transforming, translating, shapeshifting the knowledge is the key to make it digestible for others, and the biggest **challenge** (along with the greatest result) is when you can translate information from a format to a complete opposite while still retaining the essence. Then, our sessions were not as much about Python, functions, classes, statements, but more about blocks, machines, tools, woodworking and machinery, with its corresponding code equivalents.

The result? He was writing Python code as the result of his mind thinking **mechanically** about the stuff he was already **familiar with**, finally fulfilling the dream of writing code by himself, and more importantly, **understanding** it, enjoying every session we had, even with the ones that touched into topics that I wasn't so experienced about and had to investigate a bit, as he later told me:

> It's encouraging seeing someone learn something just to explain it to you. It motivates others to follow the same path, giving this feeling that <Underline>we can all learn anything</Underline>.

Those words marked my life moving forward, as it directly relates with the next part of this post.

## Learn to teach, teach to learn

Some of you might've already figured this out right away, but if you haven't, let me tell you: everything I've just shared is **not new**, in fact, it took me a while to finally discover it has a very well established name: _The Feynman Method_[^1].

[^1]: [The Feynman Technique: Master the Art of Learning](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/).

![Professor Richard P. Feynman, Nobel laureate in Physics.](./assets/004/feynman.webp)

> The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.
>
> ‚Äì Mortimer Adler

Richard Feynman, apart from being one of the greatest minds of our time, was also a master of **demystifying complex topics** (does that sound familiar?). His key learning insight: _complexity and jargon often mask a lack of understanding_, which is exactly what we previously discussed to be one of the greatest struggles on general learning, and the way of achieving it: _learn, teach, simplify, repeat_. That's what we just went over!

And it's no surprise that this is such an effective method. Think about it, putting yourself in the position to **teach** something might feel like a very vulnerable spot. **Tons** of **unanticipated** questions might come up from various different **points of view** from people that might _not_ know the subject, but have their own way of approaching it.

That's _exactly_ what we're looking for, a two-way **learning loop**, a way to look at our knowledge capable of finding points for **improvement**, simplification **techniques**, finding **gaps** in our own understanding of the matter such that, after closing them, connections (that were previously not visible to us) arise from the learning. Simply put:

- Don't be **afraid**, present what you know.
- Listen, listen, and listen again to **questions**, or **feedback**.
- If there's not a clear answer, **go back**, revisit your knowledge, find the answer you're looking for, and **try again**.

You might think ‚ÄúWell, this all sounds very academic‚Äù, but here comes the best part ‚Äì it's a **universal** method, meaning, you can apply it **anywhere** you want, regardless of the subject, the circumstances, or the people involved, just like your **professional development**.

## Professional life

Yes, you **can** apply everything I've just mentioned at work too, in fact, you have **no idea** how beneficial it is, I would say this is the **best** place to put in practice everything we've just gone through so far, because, compared to school, at work we're **expected to learn** and **adapt** at a very frequent basis for a living, **specially in the tech space**.

![Tech is often filled with huge communication and knowledge gaps.](./assets/004/tech.webp)

You might think ‚Äúwell, how exactly? I just make websites‚Äù, but there's more to it than you can imagine! Even if you're a **freelancer**, or the only developer/designer/whatever in your project, you'll often have to **communicate** and **work** with others to get the job done, and wherever there's communication, **everything** we've discussed comes into play.

See, by walking through this perspective of approaching learning, you didn't just **learned** how to **learn**, you've actually just figured out how to **talk to a client** and **know about their business**, you also learned how to **talk to your team**, and translate **business requirements** into **technical specifications** and vice-versa. You've just placed yourself at a position where you **can understand** every angle of a project, every corner of a team by just asking the right questions, and this makes you a **bridge** between every party involved.

Companies **need** this type of profiles, someone that can **learn** and **adapt**, someone that can **ask questions** and **refine knowledge**, someone that can **close gaps** between the teams, and can **consolidate information**, just like a study group at college, and someone that can **actively listen** to the **needs** of their coworkers, be available to **assist** anyone, and lead them to **growth**.

## You can be that person too

You've read that right. Yes, I'm 100% **sure** about what I'm saying, you **can** be that person I just mentioned above. Everything I've just presented, though it might sounds as I've been building up to what being a **mentor has felt like**, and what it results on, what I've actually been trying to elaborate on is to let you know **how you can follow the same steps**, and even if you don't have someone to learn from, you can then **become** **that person for others**.

![The effects of mentorship propagate just like a chain reaction.](./assets/004/meeting.webp)

There's so much people out there seeking so hard to **learn**, **grow**, and just go **beyond** what they consider **being capable of**, in the need of someone that can kick things off in the **right direction**, someone that **understands**, and that can listen and follow them through their **thought process** to finally reach the final destination, a desire to know more. If you can relate to that feeling, my message to you is that you **can** be that person.

You can become the **pillar** your team needs, the **go-to person** to learn about something specific, even when you _might not think_ you're capable of it, let me tell you, you **are**, and everything I've just shared is actually not about me, is about how anyone can grow these **teaching skills** as a **way** **to learn** as well.

You might think ‚Äúthere's so much I don't know, how am I going to be able to answer questions about it?‚Äù, and that's the key, you're **not** supposed to, not at the first try, see, it's not about **knowing**, but to **share** with everyone else that, though you might _not_ have an **answer**, there's **always a way to figure it out**.

Believe me when I say that it's more **inspirational** for others than you might think, from helping others finish a course they considered hard, to being a highly valuable team member at your job, all the way through people and experiences that **will** find your approach to knowledge encouraging, inspirational, and motivating, spreading this **healthy** and **fulfilling** way of learning, and **sharing knowledge** with others in the most **humble** way possible, **seeding** mentors everywhere you go, in hopes that one day, we'll all have **someone to look up to**.

As I always say, we're all **humans**, we don't (and will never) know **everything**, but whatever life throws at us, we can **always** figure that out, together.
