      I probably forgot to build the page you're looking for â€“ but no worries,
      you can still look around my <Link href="/">homepage</Link> or my <Link
        href="/blog"
      >
        {/* */}blog{/* */}
      </Link> blog for some good reads.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph style="--stagger:12" data-animate>
      <Italic>Perhaps this page will exist in the future...</Italic>
    </Paragraph>
  </Body>
